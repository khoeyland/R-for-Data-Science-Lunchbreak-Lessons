has lost one who for many years has stood foremost in large-hearted
Christian benevolence.  The poor have been deprived of a kind friend, to
whose liberality they might ever resort.  The children have been bereaved
of one who has for years been anxious to devote her attentive care to
their early training; and all who have ever needed a sympathizing friend
have followed one this day to the grave as warm-hearted, energetic, and
intelligent as is often to be met with in society.  Her character is well
described in some lines written by herself on the death of one she dearly
lovedâ€”",

longer than the end of next week. I love thee! I love thee! I wouldst
thou wert with me; for then would my labor be joyful--and even now it
is not sorrowful. Dearest, I shall make an excellent husbandman. I
feel the original Adam reviving within me.",

bps rate, the more quickly a modem can send and receive information.
