  CRAN Task Views have been available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network since 2005. They provide guidance about which CRAN packages are relevant for tasks related to a certain topic, and can also facilitate automatic installation of all corresponding packages. Motivated by challenges from the growth of CRAN and the R community as a whole since 2005, all of the task views infrastructure and workflows were rethought and relaunched in 2021 /
  22 in order to facilitate maintenance, and to foster deeper interactions with the R community. The redesign encompasses the establishment of a group of CRAN Task View Editors, moving all task view sources to dedicated GitHub repositories, adopting well -
  documented workflows with a code of conduct, and leveraging R / Markdown files (rather than XML) for the content of the task views.
